Since the early days of my life as a researcher, I have been interested in *computational methods* applied to _physics_.
Before starting my PhD I performed research in [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) algorithms, first applied to statistical systems like [corrugated surfaces](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/2009/02/P02049/pdf) (two-dimensional) and then applied to [quantum gauge theories](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FJHEP08%282010%29119) (four-dimensional), with ties to theories of gravity.

I expanded my physics reach during my PhD, studying gauge theories with [extra dimensions](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0217751X16430028) and quantum field theories with scalars and fermions.
*Computational methods* were still at the center of my research.
In particular, I used [Lattice Field Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_field_theory) methods to investigate *strongly-coupled theories* which are not amenable to perturbative analytical methods.
I was interested in gauge theories that could give rise to a [particle similar to the Higgs boson](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.162001), and that could extend our current knowledge of particle physics, currently summarized in the mathematically beautiful [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model).

During my first postdoctoral appointment, I continued exploring [gauge theories with Higgs candidates](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.89.111502), but I also started studying [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) theories.
Using numerical simulations of *strongly-coupled theories*, I investigated possible dark matter candidates that are [tightly-bound heavy composite states](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.171803), but also elementary dark matter candidates like the [axion](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.92.034507), which are very light.
I also started an independent project about low-dimensional gauge theories connected to quantum gravity in order to test the [holographic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle), also called *gauge/gravity* duality conjecture.
The powerful computational resources used in this project allowed me to complete the [best test](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.94.094501) of the holographic principle in 1 dimension, using numerical methods.

In my second postdoctoral appointment, I have started studying the properties of the [neutron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron) from the *fundamental theory* of its constituents, quarks and gluons.
This theory, called [Quantum Chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics), can be solved using numerical Lattice Field theory methods but it requires the most powerful supercomputers in the [world](https://www.top500.org).
One of the achievements is the calculation of the strength of interaction between the neutron and the weak gauge boson of the *Standard Model*.
With an accuracy of 1% we can [predict](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0161-8) this strength directly from the equations of the fundamental theory, and this can reveal important signals of new physics when confronted with experimental [results](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01203-9) about the life of neutrons.

My current research topics are in the field of *scientific machine learning*, that is applications of *artificial intelligence* techniques to solve difficult physics problems or accelerate scientific discoveries.
