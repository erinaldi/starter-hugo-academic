abstract: Can we use quantum computing to answer important questions in quantum field theory? Once we can formulate the problem on a quantum computer, the next step is to benchmark different algorithms in practice and find the best way forward. I will present an application of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) to a supersymmetric quantum field theory and identify the required resources for future calculations.
