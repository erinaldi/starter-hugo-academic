summary:
abstract: "Lattice field theories are a useful tool to define gauge theories in their non- perturbative regime. At the same time, the gauge/gravity duality conjectures that certain gauge theories in the non-perturbative regime are dual to weakly-coupled gravity. This suggests the possibility of relating weakly-coupled gravity to gauge theories defined on the lattice. As a first step, this conjecture needs to be tested by comparing suitable observables on both sides of the duality. This first step has been successfully carried out as I will show and the duality can be used as a non-perturbative definition of gravity via gauge theories defined on a lattice, and can make new and unexpected predictions. I will show examples in D0-branes quantum mechanics and explore quantitatively and non- perturbatively both the gauge/gravity duality and phase transitions. In addition to testing the duality, we will add some predictions to stringy corrections in the gravity side, assuming the validity of the duality."

Quantizing gravity has been one of the most difficult problems in physics. There have been many approaches to quantizing gravity, which have given us mathematically and physically interesting ideas, such as the unification of forces, the emergence of spacetime, the problem of time, spacetime foam, non-commutativity/non-associativity of spacetime, non-locality, holography, etc. Geometry, which initially found a link to gravity by Einstein has been playing a major role in the studies of quantum gravity. Quantum field theory (QFT), which gave us a tremendous success in describing the Standard Model including the weak, the strong and the electromagnetic forces, is also a central solid modern tool in describing physical systems with many degrees of freedom. QFT lets us explore critical phenomena and the scale dependence of the physics through the renormalization group.

In this workshop/conference, we focus on such pillars of modern physics which are tied together in the research of quantum gravity. We aim at creating an open versatile atmosphere in order to advance further in the better understanding of each approaches in order to understand the grand problems of quantum description of gravitation. We also aim at introducing such different approaches and topics to each other including students, therefore creating a platform to expose young generations and also older generations to various ideas and communities. Therefore the talks are recommended to take blackboard-talk format.
