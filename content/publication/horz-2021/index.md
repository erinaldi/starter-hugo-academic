abstract: We report on the first application of the stochastic Laplacian Heaviside
  method for computing multi-particle interactions with lattice QCD to the two-nucleon
  system. Like the Laplacian Heaviside method, this method allows for the construction
  of interpolating operators which can be used to construct a positive definite set
  of two-nucleon correlation functions, unlike nearly all other applications of lattice
  QCD to two nucleons in the literature. It also allows for a variational analysis
  in which optimal linear combinations of the interpolating operators are formed that
  couple predominantly to the eigenstates of the system. Utilizing such methods has
  become of paramount importance in order to help resolve the discrepancy in the literature
  on whether two nucleons in either isospin channel form a bound state at pion masses
  heavier than physical, with the discrepancy persisting even in the $SU(3)$-flavor
  symmetric point with all quark masses near the physical strange quark mass. This
  is the first in a series of papers aimed at resolving this discrepancy. In the present
  work, we employ the stochastic Laplacian Heaviside method without a hexaquark operator
  in the basis at a lattice spacing of $a\sim0.086$̃fm, lattice volume of
  $L=48a\simeq4.1$̃fm and pion mass $m_\pi\simeq714$ MeV.
  With this setup, the observed spectrum of two-nucleon energy levels strongly disfavors
  the presence of a bound state in either the deuteron or dineutron channel.
