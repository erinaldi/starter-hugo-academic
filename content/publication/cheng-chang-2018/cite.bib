 abstract = {We present state-of-the-art results from a lattice QCD calculation of the nucleon axial coupling, \$g_A\$, using M$\backslash$"obius Domain-Wall fermions solved on the dynamical \$N_f = 2 + 1 + 1\$ HISQ ensembles after they are smeared using the gradient-flow algorithm. Relevant three-point correlation functions are calculated using a method inspired by the Feynman-Hellmann theorem, and demonstrate significant improvement in signal for fixed stochastic samples. The calculation is performed at five pion masses of \$m_\backslashpi\backslashsim \backslash\400, 350, 310, 220, 130\backslash\\$̃MeV, three lattice spacings of \$a\backslashsim\backslash\0.15, 0.12, 0.09\backslash\\$\̃fm, and we do a dedicated volume study with \$m_\backslashpi L\backslashsim\backslash\3.22, 4.29, 5.36\backslash\\$. Control over all relevant sources of systematic uncertainty are demonstrated and quantified. We achieve a preliminary value of \$g_A = 1.285(17)\$, with a relative uncertainty of 1.33$\backslash$%.},
