abstract: We present state-of-the-art results from a lattice QCD calculation of the
  nucleon axial coupling, $g_A$, using M$\$\"obius Domain-Wall fermions solved
  on the dynamical $N_f = 2 + 1 + 1$ HISQ ensembles after they are smeared using the
  gradient-flow algorithm. Relevant three-point correlation functions are calculated
  using a method inspired by the Feynman-Hellmann theorem, and demonstrate significant
  improvement in signal for fixed stochastic samples. The calculation is performed
  at five pion masses of $m_\pi\sim \400, 350, 310, 220, 130\$̃MeV,
  three lattice spacings of $a\sim\0.15, 0.12, 0.09\$̃fm,
  and we do a dedicated volume study with $m_\pi L\sim\3.22,
  4.29, 5.36\$. Control over all relevant sources of systematic uncertainty
  are demonstrated and quantified. We achieve a preliminary value of $g_A = 1.285(17)$,
  with a relative uncertainty of 1.33$\$%.
