abstract: 'We present a new model of \"Stealth Dark Matter\": a composite baryonic
  scalar of an $SU(N_D)$ strongly-coupled theory with even $N_D backslashgeq 4$. All
  mass scales are technically natural, and dark matter stability is automatic without
  imposing an additional discrete or global symmetry. Constituent fermions transform
  in vector-like representations of the electroweak group that permit both electroweak-breaking
  and electroweak-preserving mass terms. This gives a tunable coupling of stealth
  dark matter to the Higgs boson independent of the dark matter mass itself. We specialize
  to $SU(4)$, and investigate the constraints on the model from dark meson decay,
  electroweak precision measurements, basic collider limits, and spin-independent
  direct detection scattering through Higgs exchange. We exploit our earlier lattice
  simulations that determined the composite spectrum as well as the effective Higgs
  coupling of stealth dark matter in order to place bounds from direct detection,
  excluding constituent fermions with dominantly electroweak-breaking masses. A lower
  bound on the dark baryon mass $m_B backslashgtrsim 300$ GeV is obtained from the
  indirect requirement that the lightest dark meson not be observable at LEP II. We
  briefly survey some intriguing properties of stealth dark matter that are worthy
  of future study, including: collider studies of dark meson production and decay;
  indirect detection signals from annihilation; relic abundance estimates for both
  symmetric and asymmetric mechanisms; and direct detection through electromagnetic
  polarizability, a detailed study of which will appear in a companion paper.'
