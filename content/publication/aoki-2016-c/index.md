abstract: SU(3) gauge theory with eight massless fundamental fermions seems to be
  near the conformal boundary, and is a candidate theory of walking technicolor. Along
  the series of study by LatKMI collaboration using HISQ fermions, S-parameter and
  vector decay constant, which provide important constraints in the model of electroweak
  symmetry breaking, are calculated for this theory. Use of various volumes allows
  a systematic investigation of finite volume effects. A strong sensitivity of the
  S-parameter to the volume is found.
