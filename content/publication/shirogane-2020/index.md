abstract: We study latent heat and the pressure gap between the hot and cold phases
  at the first-order deconfining phase transition temperature of the SU(3) Yang-Mills
  theory. Performing simulations on lattices with various spatial volumes and lattice
  spacings, we calculate the gaps of the energy density and pressure using the small
  flow-time expansion (SFtX) method. We find that the latent heat $backslashDelta
  backslashepsilon$ in the continuum limit is $backslashDelta backslashepsilon /T^4
  = 1.117 backslashpm 0.040$ for the aspect ratio $N_s/N_t=8$ and $1.349 backslashpm
  0.038$ for $N_s/N_t=6$ at the transition temperature $T=T_c$. We also confirm that
  the pressure gap is consistent with zero, as expected from the dynamical balance
  of two phases at $T_c$. From hysteresis curves of the energy density near $T_c$,
  we show that the energy density in the (metastable) deconfined phase is sensitive
  to the spatial volume, while that in the confined phase is insensitive. Furthermore,
  we examine the effect of alternative procedures in the SFtX method - the order of
  the continuum and the vanishing flow-time extrapolations, and also the renormalization
  scale and higher-order corrections in the matching coefficients. We confirm that
  the final results are all very consistent with each other for these alternatives.
