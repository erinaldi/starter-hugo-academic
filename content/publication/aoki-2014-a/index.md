abstract: We measure glueball masses and the string tension in twelve-flavour QCD,
  aiming at comparing the emerging gluonic spectrum to the mesonic one. When approaching
  the critical surface at zero quark mass, the hierarchy of masses in the different
  sectors of the spectrum gives a new handle to determine the existence of an infrared
  fixed point. We describe the details of our gluonic measurements and the results
  obtained on a large number of gauge configurations generated with the HISQ action.
  In particular, we focus on the scalar glueball and its mixing with a flavour-singlet
  fermionic state, which is lighter than the pseudoscalar (would-be pion) state. The
  results are interesting in view of a light composite Higgs boson in walking technicolor
  theories.
