 abstract = {We measure glueball masses and the string tension in twelve-flavour QCD, aiming at comparing the emerging gluonic spectrum to the mesonic one. When approaching the critical surface at zero quark mass, the hierarchy of masses in the different sectors of the spectrum gives a new handle to determine the existence of an infrared fixed point. We describe the details of our gluonic measurements and the results obtained on a large number of gauge configurations generated with the HISQ action. In particular, we focus on the scalar glueball and its mixing with a flavour-singlet fermionic state, which is lighter than the pseudoscalar (would-be pion) state. The results are interesting in view of a light composite Higgs boson in walking technicolor theories.},
