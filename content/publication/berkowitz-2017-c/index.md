abstract: We report on salient features of a mixed lattice QCD action using valence
  M$backslash$\"obius domain-wall fermions solved on the dynamical $N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ
  ensembles generated by the MILC Collaboration. The approximate chiral symmetry properties
  of the valence fermions are shown to be significantly improved by utilizing the
  gradient-flow scheme to first smear the HISQ configurations. The greater numerical
  cost of the M$backslash$\"obius domain-wall inversions is mitigated by the highly
  efficient QUDA library optimized for NVIDIA GPU accelerated compute nodes. We have
  created an interface to this optimized QUDA solver in Chroma. We provide tuned parameters
  of the action and performance of QUDA using ensembles with the lattice spacings
  $a backslashsimeq backslash0.15, 0.12, 0.09backslash$ fm and pion masses $m_backslashpi
  backslashsimeq backslash310, 220,130backslash$ MeV. We have additionally generated
  two new ensembles with $abackslashsim0.12$ fm and $m_backslashpibackslashsimbackslash400,
  350backslash$ MeV. With a fixed flow-time of $t_gf=1$ in lattice units, the residual
  chiral symmetry breaking of the valence fermions is kept below 10$backslash$% of
  the light quark mass on all ensembles, $m_res backslashlesssim 0.1backslashtimes
  m_l$, with moderate values of the fifth dimension $L_5$ and a domain-wall height
  $M_5 backslashleq 1.3$. As a benchmark calculation, we perform a continuum, infinite
  volume, physical pion and kaon mass extrapolation of $F_K^backslashpm/F_backslashpi^backslashpm$
  and demonstrate our results are independent of flow-time, and consistent with the
  FLAG determination of this quantity at the level of less than one standard deviation.
