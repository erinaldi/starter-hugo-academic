abstract: We explore the phase diagram of the SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in 5 dimensions
  by numerical simulations. The lattice system shows a dimensionally-reduced phase
  where the extra dimension is small compared to the four dimensional correlation
  length. In the low-energy regime of this phase, the system behaves like a four-dimensional
  gauge theory coupled to an adjoint scalar field. By tuning the bare parameters of
  the lattice model, we identify lines of constant physics, and analyse the behaviour
  of the non-perturbative scalar mass as a function of the compactification and the
  cut-off scales. The perturbative prediction that the effective theory contains a
  light particle with a mass that is independent of the cut-off is tested against
  non-pertubative results.
