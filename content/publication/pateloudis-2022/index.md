abstract: We test a conjecture by Maldacena and Milekhin for the ungauged version
  of the Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase (BMN) matrix model by lattice Monte Carlo simulation.
  The numerical results reproduce the perturbative and gravity results in the limit
  of large and small flux parameter, respectively, and are consistent with the conjecture.
