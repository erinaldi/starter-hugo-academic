abstract: We present results for the spectrum of a strongly interacting SU(3) gauge
  theory with $N_f = 8$ light fermions in the fundamental representation. Carrying
  out non-perturbative lattice calculations at the lightest masses and largest volumes
  considered to date, we confirm the existence of a remarkably light singlet scalar
  particle. We explore the rich resonance spectrum of the 8-flavor theory in the context
  of the search for new physics beyond the standard model at the Large Hadron Collider
  (LHC). Connecting our results to models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking,
  we estimate the vector resonance mass to be about 2 TeV with a width of roughly
  450 GeV, and predict additional resonances with masses below Ìƒ3 TeV.
