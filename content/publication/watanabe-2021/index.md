abstract: We provide evidence for partial deconfinement — the deconfinement of a SU(
  M ) subgroup of the SU( N ) gauge group — by using lattice Monte Carlo simulations.
  We take matrix models as concrete examples. By appropriately fixing the gauge, we
  observe that the M × M submatrices deconfine. This gives direct evidence for partial
  deconfinement at strong coupling. We discuss the applications to QCD and holography.
