 abstract = {We provide evidence for partial deconfinement — the deconfinement of a SU( M ) subgroup of the SU( N ) gauge group — by using lattice Monte Carlo simulations. We take matrix models as concrete examples. By appropriately fixing the gauge, we observe that the M × M submatrices deconfine. This gives direct evidence for partial deconfinement at strong coupling. We discuss the applications to QCD and holography.},
