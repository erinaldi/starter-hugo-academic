 abstract = {The Hubble constant (\$H_0\$) tension between Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) and Planck measurements ranges from 4 to 6 \$\backslashsigma\$. To investigate this tension, we estimate \$H_\0\\$ in the \$\backslashLambda\$CDM and \$w_\0\w_\a\\$CDM models by dividing the Pantheon sample, the largest compilation of SNe Ia, into 3, 4, 20 and 40 bins. We fit the extracted \$H_\0\\$ values with a function mimicking the redshift evolution: \$g(z)=\H_0\(z)=\backslashtilde\H\_0/(1+z)^\backslashalpha\$, where \$\backslashalpha\$ indicates an evolutionary parameter and \$\backslashtilde\H\_0=H_0\$ at \$z=0\$. We set the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia so that \$H_0=73.5\backslash,\backslash, \backslashtextrm\km s\̂-1\\backslash,\backslashtextrm\Mpc\-̂1\\$, and we fix fiducial values for \$\backslashOmega_\0m\^b̂ackslashLambda CDM\=0.298\$ and \$\backslashOmega_\0m\^\\̂0\w_\a\CDM\=0.308\$. We find that \$H_0\$ evolves with redshift, showing a slowly decreasing trend, with \$\backslashalpha\$ coefficients consistent with zero only from 1.2 to 2.0 \$\backslashsigma\$. Although the \$\backslashalpha\$ coefficients are compatible with 0 in 3 \$\backslashsigma\$, this however may affect cosmological results. We measure locally a variation of \$H_0(z=0)-H_0(z=1)=0.4\backslash, \backslashtextrm\km s\^\-\̂backslash,\backslashtextrm\Mpc\^\-1$̂ in 3 and 4 bins. Extrapolating \$\H_0\(z)\$ to \$z=1100\$, the redshift of the last scattering surface, we obtain values of \$H_0\$ compatible in 1 \$\backslashsigma\$ with Planck measurements independently of cosmological models and number of bins we investigated. Thus, we have reduced the \$H_0\$ tension from \$54\backslash%\$ to \$72\backslash%\$ for the \$\backslashLambda\$CDM and \$w_\0\w_\a\\$CDM models, respectively. If the decreasing trend of \$H_0(z)\$ is real, it could be due to astrophysical selection effects or to modified gravity.},
