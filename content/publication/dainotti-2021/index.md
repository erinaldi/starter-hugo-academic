title: On the Hubble Constant Tension in the SNe Ia Pantheon Sample
subtitle: ''
summary: 'The Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension between Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia)
  and Planck measurements ranges from 4 to 6 $\sigma$. To investigate this
  tension, we estimate $H_0$ in the $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM models by
  dividing the Pantheon sample, the largest compilation of SNe Ia, into 3, 4, 20 and
  40 bins.'

abstract: 'The Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension between Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia)
  and Planck measurements ranges from 4 to 6 $\sigma$. To investigate this
  tension, we estimate $H_0$ in the $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM models by
  dividing the Pantheon sample, the largest compilation of SNe Ia, into 3, 4, 20 and
  40 bins. We fit the extracted $H_0$ values with a function mimicking the redshift
  evolution: $g(z)=H_0(z)=\tilde{H_0}/(1+z)^\alpha$, where $\alpha$
  indicates an evolutionary parameter and $\tilde{H_0}=H_0$ at $z=0$. We set
  the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia so that $H_0=73.5\\, \textrm{km}\\, s^{-1} \\, \textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and we fix fiducial values for $\Omega_{0m}^{\Lambda
  CDM}=0.298$ and $\Omega_{0m}^{w_0w_aCDM}=0.308$. We find that $H_0$ evolves with
  redshift, showing a slowly decreasing trend, with $\alpha$ coefficients
  consistent with zero only from 1.2 to 2.0 $\sigma$. Although the $\alpha$
  coefficients are compatible with 0 in 3 $\sigma$, this however may affect
  cosmological results. We measure locally a variation of $H_0(z=0)-H_0(z=1)=0.4\,
  \textrm{km}\\, s^{-1} \\, \textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ in 3 and 4 bins. Extrapolating
  $H_0(z)$ to $z=1100$, the redshift of the last scattering surface, we obtain values
  of $H_0$ compatible in 1 $\sigma$ with Planck measurements independently
  of cosmological models and number of bins we investigated. Thus, we have reduced
  the $H_0$ tension from $54\%$ to $72\%$ for the $\Lambda$CDM
  and $w_0w_a$CDM models, respectively. If the decreasing trend of $H_0(z)$ is real,
  it could be due to astrophysical selection effects or to modified gravity.'
