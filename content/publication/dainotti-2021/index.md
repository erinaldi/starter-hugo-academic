abstract: 'The Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension between Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia)
  and Planck measurements ranges from 4 to 6 $backslashsigma$. To investigate this
  tension, we estimate $H_0$ in the $backslashLambda$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM models by
  dividing the Pantheon sample, the largest compilation of SNe Ia, into 3, 4, 20 and
  40 bins. We fit the extracted $H_0$ values with a function mimicking the redshift
  evolution: $g(z)=H_0(z)=backslashtildeH_0/(1+z)^backslashalpha$, where $backslashalpha$
  indicates an evolutionary parameter and $backslashtildeH_0=H_0$ at $z=0$. We set
  the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia so that $H_0=73.5backslash,backslash, backslashtextrmkm
  ŝ-1backslash,backslashtextrmMpc-̂1$, and we fix fiducial values for $backslashOmega_0m^b̂ackslashLambda
  CDM=0.298$ and $backslashOmega_0m^̂0w_aCDM=0.308$. We find that $H_0$ evolves with
  redshift, showing a slowly decreasing trend, with $backslashalpha$ coefficients
  consistent with zero only from 1.2 to 2.0 $backslashsigma$. Although the $backslashalpha$
  coefficients are compatible with 0 in 3 $backslashsigma$, this however may affect
  cosmological results. We measure locally a variation of $H_0(z=0)-H_0(z=1)=0.4backslash,
  backslashtextrmkm s^-̂backslash,backslashtextrmMpc^-1$̂ in 3 and 4 bins. Extrapolating
  $H_0(z)$ to $z=1100$, the redshift of the last scattering surface, we obtain values
  of $H_0$ compatible in 1 $backslashsigma$ with Planck measurements independently
  of cosmological models and number of bins we investigated. Thus, we have reduced
  the $H_0$ tension from $54backslash%$ to $72backslash%$ for the $backslashLambda$CDM
  and $w_0w_a$CDM models, respectively. If the decreasing trend of $H_0(z)$ is real,
  it could be due to astrophysical selection effects or to modified gravity.'
