# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "Lattice gauge theory is a robust framework to study non-perturbative physics andit is amenable to numerical simulations. It has been succesfully used to study the low-energy regime of QCD. Modern-day lattice simulation codes are actually flexible enough that users can change the theory being simulated: we can study different number of colors $N_c$ , number of quarks $N_f$ and quarks in different representations $N_r$ , in addition to the usual parameters, gauge coupling $\\beta$ and quark masses $m_f$. These new theories, although interesting in their own right as well-defined gauge theories, can be used as templates to study physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). I will report on a particular SU(3) gauge theory with 8 fermions in the fundamental representation. In particular I will highlight howl attice simulations of the flavor-singlet scalar and pseudoscalar spectrum compare to QCD."
