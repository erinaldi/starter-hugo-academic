abstract: 'The $\textitaxial coupling of the nucleon$, $g_A$, is the strength
  of its coupling to the $\textitweak$ axial current of the Standard Model
  of particle physics, in much the same way as the electric charge is the strength
  of the coupling to the electromagnetic current. This axial coupling dictates the
  rate at which neutrons decay to protons, the strength of the attractive long-range
  force between nucleons and other features of nuclear physics. Precision tests of
  the Standard Model in nuclear environments require a quantitative understanding
  of nuclear physics rooted in Quantum Chromodynamics, a pillar of the Standard Model.
  The prominence of $g_A$ makes it a benchmark quantity to determine theoretically
  - a difficult task because quantum chromodynamics is non-perturbative, precluding
  known analytical methods. Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics provides a rigorous, non-perturbative
  definition of quantum chromodynamics that can be implemented numerically. It has
  been estimated that a precision of two percent would be possible by 2020 if two
  challenges are overcome: contamination of $g_A$ from excited states must be controlled
  in the calculations and statistical precision must be improved markedly. Here we
  report a calculation of $g_A^QCD = 1.271\pm0.013$, using an unconventional
  method inspired by the Feynman-Hellmann theorem that overcomes these challenges.'
