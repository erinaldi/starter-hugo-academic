abstract: Matrix elements of six-quark operators are needed to extract new physics
  constraints from experimental searches for neutron-antineutron oscillations. This
  work presents in detail the first lattice quantum chromodynamics calculations of
  the necessary neutron-antineutron transition matrix elements including calculation
  methods and discussions of systematic uncertainties. Implications of isospin and
  chiral symmetry on the matrix elements, power counting in the isospin limit, and
  renormalization of a chiral basis of six-quark operators are discussed. Calculations
  are performed with a chiral-symmetric discretization of the quark action and physical
  light quark masses in order to avoid the need for chiral extrapolation. Non-perturbative
  renormalization is performed, including a study of lattice cutoff effects. Excited-state
  effects are studied using two nucleon operators and multiple values of source-sink
  separation. Results for the dominant matrix elements are found to be significantly
  larger compared to previous results from the MIT bag model. Future calculations
  are needed to fully account for systematic uncertainties associated with discretization
  and finite-volume effects but are not expected to significantly affect this conclusion.
