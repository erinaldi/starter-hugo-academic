abstract: The lowest-lying glueball masses are computed in SU($N$) gauge theory on
  a spacetime lattice for constant value of the lattice spacing $a$ and for $N$ ranging
  from 3 to 8. The lattice spacing is fixed using the deconfinement temperature at
  temporal extension of the lattice $N_T = 6$. The calculation is conducted employing
  in each channel a variational ansatz performed on a large basis of operators that
  includes also torelon and (for the lightest states) scattering trial functions.
  This basis is constructed using an automatic algorithm that allows us to build operators
  of any size and shape in any irreducible representation of the cubic group. A good
  signal is extracted for the ground state and the first excitation in several symmetry
  channels. It is shown that all the observed states are well described by their large
  $N$ values, with modest $\$$\cal O(1/N^2)$ corrections. In addition
  spurious states are identified that couple to torelon and scattering operators.
  As a byproduct of our calculation, the critical couplings for the deconfinement
  phase transition for N=5 and N=7 and temporal extension of the lattice $N_T=6$ are
  determined.
