abstract: The origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry apparently obligates the laws
  of physics to include some mechanism of baryon number ($\mathcal{B}$) violation.
  Searches for interactions violating $\mathcal{B}$ and baryon-minus-lepton
  number $\mathcal{(B-L)}$ represent a rich and underutilized opportunity. These
  are complementary to the existing, broad program of searches for $\mathcal{L}$-violating
  modes such as neutrinoless double $\beta$-decay which could provide deeper
  understandings of the plausibility of leptogenesis, or $\mathcal{B}$-violating,
  $\mathcal(B-L)$-conserving processes such as proton decay. In particular,
  a low-scale, post-sphaleron violation mechanism of $\mathcal(B-L)$ could
  provide a testable form of baryogenesis. Though theoretically compelling,
  searches for such $\mathcal(B-L)$-violating processes like $\Delta\mathcal{B}=2$
  dinucleon decay and $n\rightarrow\barn$ remain relatively underexplored
  experimentally compared to other rare processes. By taking advantage of upcoming
  facilities such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment and the European Spallation
  Source, this gap can be addressed with new intranuclear and free searches for neutron
  transformations with very high sensitivity, perhaps greater than three orders of
  magnitude higher than previous experimental searches. This proceedings reports on
  recent theoretical and experimental advances and sensitivities of next-generation
  searches for neutron transformations were detailed as part of the Amherst Center
  for Fundamental Interactions Workshop, \"Theoretical Innovations for Future Experiments
  Regarding Baryon Number Violation,\" directly coordinated with the Rare Processes
  and Precision Measurements Frontier.
