abstract: We use a variational technique to study heavy glueballs on gauge configurations
  generated with 2+1 flavours of ASQTAD improved staggered fermions. The variational
  technique includes glueball scattering states. The measurements were made using
  2150 configurations at 0.092 fm with a pion mass of 360 MeV. We report masses for
  10 glueball states. We discuss the prospects for unquenched lattice QCD calculations
  of the oddballs.
