abstract: The search for neutrinoless double beta decay of nuclei is believed to be
  one of the most promising means to search for new physics. Observation of this very
  rare nuclear process, which violates Lepton Number conservation, would imply the
  neutrino sector has a Majorana mass component and may also provide an explanation
  for the universe matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. In the case where
  a heavy intermediate particle is exchanged in this process, QCD contributions from
  short range interactions become relevant and the calculation of matrix elements
  with four-quark operators becomes necessary. In these proceedings we will discuss
  our current progress in the calculation of these four-quark operators from LQCD.
