abstract: We study the bosonic matrix model obtained as the high-temperature limit
  of two-dimensional maximally supersymmetric SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory. So far, no
  consensus about the order of the deconfinement transition in this theory has been
  reached and this hinders progress in understanding the nature of the black hole/black
  string topology change from the gauge/gravity duality perspective. On the one hand,
  previous works considered the deconfinement transition consistent with two transitions
  which are of second and third order. On the other hand, evidence for a first order
  transition was put forward more recently. We perform high-statistics lattice Monte
  Carlo simulations at large $N$ and small lattice spacing to establish that the transition
  is really of first order. Our findings flag a warning that the required large-$N$
  and continuum limit might not have been reached in earlier publications, and that
  was the source of the discrepancy. Moreover, our detailed results confirm the existence
  of a new partially deconfined phase which describes non-uniform black strings via
  the gauge/gravity duality. This phase exhibits universal features already predicted
  in quantum field theory.
