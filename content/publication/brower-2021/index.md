abstract: We use non-perturbative lattice calculations to investigate the finite-temperature
  confinement transition of stealth dark matter, focusing on the regime in which this
  early-universe transition is first order and would generate a stochastic background
  of gravitational waves. Stealth dark matter extends the standard model with a new
  strongly coupled SU(4) gauge sector with four massive fermions in the fundamental
  representation, producing a stable spin-0 'dark baryon' as a viable composite dark
  matter candidate. Future searches for stochastic gravitational waves will provide
  a new way to discover or constrain stealth dark matter, in addition to previously
  investigated direct-detection and collider experiments. As a first step to enabling
  this phenomenology, we determine how heavy the dark fermions need to be in order
  to produce a first-order stealth dark matter confinement transition.
