# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "Matrix quantum mechanics plays various important roles in theoretical physics, such as a holographic description of quantum black holes. Understanding quantum black holes and the role of entanglement in a holographic setup is of paramount importance for the development of better quantum algorithms (quantum error correction codes) and for the realization of a quantum theory of gravity. Quantum computing and deep learning offer us potentially useful approaches to study the dynamics of matrix quantum mechanics. In this paper we perform a systematic survey for quantum computing and deep learning approaches to matrix quantum mechanics, comparing them to Lattice Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, we test the performance of each method by calculating the low-energy spectrum"

summary: "We study the two matrix models using deep learning methods and quantum simulations. We benchmark the results against lattice Monte Carlo simulations."
