abstract: The anisotropic 5D SU(2) Yang-Mills model has been widely investigated on
  the lattice during the last decade. In the case where all dimensions are large in
  size, it was previously claimed that there is a new phase in the phase diagram,
  called the Layer phase. In this phase, the gauge fields would be localized on 4D
  layers. Previous works claim that the phase transition to the Layer phase is of
  second order, which would allow a continuum limit to be taken. We present the extension
  of the previous work to large lattices, for which we found a first order phase transition.
  This leaves the scenario that this 5D theory can be dimensionally reduced to a continuum
  4D field theory, doubtful.
