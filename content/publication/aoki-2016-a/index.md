abstract: In the search for a realistic walking technicolor model, QCD with many flavors
  is an attractive candidate. From the series of studies by the LatKMI collaboration,
  we present updated results of the scaling properties of various hadron spectra,
  including the (pseudo)scalar, vector, and baryon channels, for $N_f=8$ QCD analyzed
  with the HISQ action. By comparing these with $N_f=12$ QCD, which has properties
  consistent with conformality, possible signals of walking dynamics are discussed.
  We also present a preliminary result of the flavor-singlet pseudoscalar mass in
  many-flavor QCD.
