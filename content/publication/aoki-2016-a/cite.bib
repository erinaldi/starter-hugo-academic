 abstract = {In the search for a realistic walking technicolor model, QCD with many flavors is an attractive candidate. From the series of studies by the LatKMI collaboration, we present updated results of the scaling properties of various hadron spectra, including the (pseudo)scalar, vector, and baryon channels, for \$N_f=8\$ QCD analyzed with the HISQ action. By comparing these with \$N_f=12\$ QCD, which has properties consistent with conformality, possible signals of walking dynamics are discussed. We also present a preliminary result of the flavor-singlet pseudoscalar mass in many-flavor QCD.},
