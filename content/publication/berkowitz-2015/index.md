abstract: One intriguing BSM particle is the QCD axion, which could simultaneously
  provide a solution to the Strong CP problem and account for some, if not all, of
  the dark matter density in the universe. This particle is a pNGB of the conjectured
  Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry of the Standard Model. Its mass and interactions are
  suppressed by a heavy symmetry breaking scale, $f_a$, whose value is roughly greater
  than $10^9$ GeV (or, conversely, the axion mass, $m_a$, is roughly less than $10^4backslash
  backslashmu backslashtexteV$). The density of axions in the universe, which cannot
  exceed the relic dark matter density and is a quantity of great interest in axion
  experiments like ADMX, is a result of the early-universe interplay between cosmological
  evolution and the axion mass as a function of temperature. The latter quantity is
  proportional to the second derivative of the QCD free energy with respect to the
  CP-violating phase, $backslashtheta$. However, this quantity is generically non-perturbative
  and previous calculations have only employed instanton models at the high temperatures
  of interest (roughly 1 GeV). In this and future works, we aim to calculate the temperature-dependent
  axion mass at small $backslashtheta$ from first-principle lattice calculations,
  with controlled statistical and systematic errors. Once calculated, this temperature-dependent
  axion mass is input for the classical evolution equations of the axion density of
  the universe. Due to a variety of lattice systematic effects at the very high temperatures
  required, we perform a calculation of the leading small-$backslashtheta$ cumulant
  of the theta vacua on large volume lattices for SU(3) Yang-Mills with high statistics
  as a first proof of concept, before attempting a full QCD calculation in the future.
  From these pure glue results, the misalignment mechanism yields the axion mass bound
  $m_a backslashgeq (14.6backslashpm0.1) backslash backslashmu backslashtexteV$ when
  PQ-breaking occurs after inflation.
