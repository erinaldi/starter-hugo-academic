abstract: The deconfinement transition in SU($N_c$) Yang--Mills is investigated by
  Monte Carlo simulations of the gauge theory discretized on a spacetime lattice.
  We present new results for $ 4 \le N_c \le 8$ (in particular, for
  $N_c = 5$ and $N_c = 7$), which are analysed together with previously published
  results. The increased amount of data, the improved statistics and simulations closer
  to the continuum limit provide us with better control over systematic errors. After
  performing the thermodynamic limit, numerical results for the ratio of the critical
  temperature $T_c$ over the square root of the string tension $\sqrt\sigma$
  obtained on lattices with temporal extensions $N_t = 5,6,7,8$ are extrapolated to
  the continuum limit. The continuum results at fixed $N_c$ are then extrapolated
  to $N_c = \infty$. We find that our data are accurately described by the
  formula $T_c/\sqrt\sigma = 0.5949(17) + 0.458(18)/N_c^2$. Possible
  systematic errors affecting our calculations are also discussed.
