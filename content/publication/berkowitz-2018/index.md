abstract: The fundamental particle theory called Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) dictates
  everything about protons and neutrons, from their intrinsic properties to interactions
  that bind them into atomic nuclei. Quantities that cannot be fully resolved through
  experiment, such as the neutron lifetime (whose precise value is important for the
  existence of light-atomic elements that make the sun shine and life possible), may
  be understood through numerical solutions to QCD. We directly solve QCD using Lattice
  Gauge Theory and calculate nuclear observables such as neutron lifetime. We have
  developed an improved algorithm that exponentially decreases the time-to solution
  and applied it on the new CORAL supercomputers, Sierra and Summit. We use run-time
  autotuning to distribute GPU resources, achieving 20% performance at low node count.
  We also developed optimal application mapping through a job manager, which allows
  CPU and GPU jobs to be interleaved, yielding 15% of peak performance when deployed
  across large fractions of CORAL.
