abstract: Supersymmetric quantum gauge theories are important mathematical tools in
  high energy physics. As an example, supersymmetric matrix models can be used as
  a holographic description of quantum black holes. The wave function of such supersymmetric
  gauge theories is not known and it is challenging to obtain with traditional techniques.
  We employ a neural quantum state ansatz for the wave function of a supersymmetric
  matrix model and use a variational quantum Monte Carlo approach to discover the
  ground state of the system. We discuss the difficulty of including bosonic particles
  and fermionic particles, as well as gauge degrees of freedom.
