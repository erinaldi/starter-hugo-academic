 abstract = {Supersymmetric quantum gauge theories are important mathematical tools in high energy physics. As an example, supersymmetric matrix models can be used as a holographic description of quantum black holes. The wave function of such supersymmetric gauge theories is not known and it is challenging to obtain with traditional techniques. We employ a neural quantum state ansatz for the wave function of a supersymmetric matrix model and use a variational quantum Monte Carlo approach to discover the ground state of the system. We discuss the difficulty of including bosonic particles and fermionic particles, as well as gauge degrees of freedom.},
