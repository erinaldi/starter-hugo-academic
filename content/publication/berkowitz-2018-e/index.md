abstract: There are many outstanding problems in nuclear physics which require input
  and guidance from lattice QCD calculations of few baryons systems. However, these
  calculations suffer from an exponentially bad signal-to-noise problem which has
  prevented a controlled extrapolation to the physical point. The variational method
  has been applied very successfully to two-meson systems, allowing for the extraction
  of the two-meson states very early in Euclidean time through the use of improved
  single hadron operators. The sheer numerical cost of using the same techniques in
  two-baryon systems has so far been prohibitive. We present an alternate strategy
  which offers some of the same advantages as the variational method while being significantly
  less numerically expensive. We first use the Matrix Prony method to form an optimal
  linear combination of single baryon interpolating fields generated from the same
  source and different sink interpolating fields. Very early in Euclidean time this
  optimal linear combination is numerically free of excited state contamination, so
  we coin it a calm baryon. This calm baryon operator is then used in the construction
  of the two-baryon correlation functions.
