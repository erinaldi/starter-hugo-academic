abstract: We present our investigation of SU(2) gauge theory with 8 flavours, and
  SU(3) gauge theory with 12 flavours. For the SU(2) case, at strong bare coupling,
  $\beta \lesssim 1.45$, the distribution of the lowest eigenvalue
  of the Dirac operator can be described by chiral random matrix theory for the Gaussian
  symplectic ensemble. Our preliminary result indicates that the chiral phase transition
  in this theory is of bulk nature. For the SU(3) theory, we use high-precision lattice
  data to perform the step-scaling study of the coupling, $g_\rm GF$, in the
  Gradient Flow scheme. We carefully examine the reliability of the continuum extrapolation
  in the analysis, and conclude that the scaling behaviour of this SU(3) theory is
  not governed by possible infrared conformality at $g_\rm GF̂2 \lesssim
  6$.
