abstract: Excited state contamination remains one of the most challenging sources
  of systematic uncertainty to control in lattice QCD calculations of nucleon matrix
  elements and form factors. Most lattice QCD collaborations advocate for the use
  of high-statistics calculations at large time separations ($t_backslashrm sepbackslashgtrsim1$
  fm) to combat the signal-to-noise degradation. In this work we demonstrate that,
  for the nucleon axial charge, $g_A$, the alternative strategy of utilizing a large
  number of relatively low-statistics calculations at short to medium time separations
  ($0.2backslashlesssim t_backslashrm sepbackslashlesssim1$ fm), combined with a multi-state
  analysis, provides a more robust and economical method of quantifying and controlling
  the excited state systematic uncertainty, including correlated late-time fluctuations
  that may bias the ground state. We show that two classes of excited states largely
  cancel in the ratio of the three-point to two-point functions, leaving the third
  class, the transition matrix elements, as the dominant source of contamination.
  On an $m_backslashpibackslashapprox310$ MeV ensemble, we observe the expected exponential
  suppression of excited state contamination in the Feynman-Hellmann correlation function
  relative to the standard three-point function; the excited states of the regular
  three-point function reduce to the 1% level for $t_backslashrm sep textgreater2$
  fm while, for the Feynman-Hellmann correlation function, they are suppressed to
  1% at $t_backslashrm sepbackslashapprox1$ fm. Independent analyses of the three-point
  and Feynman-Hellmann correlators yield consistent results for the ground state.
  However, a combined analysis allows for a more detailed and robust understanding
  of the excited state contamination, improving the demonstration that the ground
  state parameters are stable against variations in the excited state model, the number
  of excited states, and the truncation of early-time or late-time numerical data.
