abstract: We calculate the spin-independent scattering cross section for direct detection
  that results from the electromagnetic polarizability of a composite scalar baryon
  dark matter candidate -- \"Stealth Dark Matter\", that is based on a dark SU(4)
  confining gauge theory. In the nonrelativistic limit, electromagnetic polarizability
  proceeds through a dimension-7 interaction leading to a very small scattering cross
  section for dark matter with weak scale masses. This represents a lower bound on
  the scattering cross section for composite dark matter theories with electromagnetically
  charged constituents. We carry out lattice calculations of the polarizability for
  the lightest baryons in SU(3) and SU(4) gauge theories using the background field
  method on quenched configurations. We find the polarizabilities of SU(3) and SU(4)
  to be comparable (within about 50%) normalized to the baryon mass, which is suggestive
  for extensions to larger SU(N) groups. The resulting scattering cross sections with
  a xenon target are shown to be potentially detectable in the dark matter mass range
  of about 200-700 GeV, where the lower bound is from the existing LUX constraint
  while the upper bound is the coherent neutrino background. Significant uncertainties
  in the cross section remain due to the more complicated interaction of the polarizablity
  operator with nuclear structure, however the steep dependence on the dark matter
  mass, $1/m_B^6$, suggests the observable dark matter mass range is not appreciably
  modified. We briefly highlight collider searches for the mesons in the theory as
  well as the indirect astrophysical effects that may also provide excellent probes
  of stealth dark matter.
