abstract: The nucleon axial coupling, $g_A$, is a fundamental property of protons
  and neutrons, dictating the strength with which the weak axial current of the Standard
  Model couples to nucleons, and hence, the lifetime of a free neutron. The prominence
  of $g_A$ in nuclear physics has made it a benchmark quantity with which to calibrate
  lattice QCD calculations of nucleon structure and more complex calculations of electroweak
  matrix elements in one and few nucleon systems. There were a number of significant
  challenges in determining $g_A$, notably the notorious exponentially-bad signal-to-noise
  problem and the requirement for hundreds of thousands of stochastic samples, that
  rendered this goal more difficult to obtain than originally thought. I will describe
  the use of an unconventional computation method, coupled with \"ludicrously'\" fast
  GPU code, access to publicly available lattice QCD configurations from MILC and
  access to leadership computing that have allowed these challenges to be overcome
  resulting in a determination of $g_A$ with 1% precision and all sources of systematic
  uncertainty controlled. I will discuss the implications of these results for the
  convergence of $SU(2)$ Chiral Perturbation theory for nucleons, as well as prospects
  for further improvements to $g_A$ (sub-percent precision, for which we have preliminary
  results) which is part of a more comprehensive application of lattice QCD to nuclear
  physics. This is particularly exciting in light of the new CORAL supercomputers
  coming online, Sierra and Summit, for which our lattice QCD codes achieve a machine-to-machine
  speed up over Titan of an order of magnitude.
