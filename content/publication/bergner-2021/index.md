abstract: We study the confinement/deconfinement transition in the D0-brane matrix
  model (often called the BFSS matrix model) and its one-parameter deformation (the
  BMN matrix model) numerically by lattice Monte Carlo simulations. Our results confirm
  general expectations from the dual string/M-theory picture for strong coupling.
  In particular, we observe the confined phase in the BFSS matrix model, which is
  a nontrivial consequence of the M-theory picture. We suggest that these models provide
  us with an ideal framework to study the Schwarzschild black hole, M-theory, and
  furthermore, the parameter region of the phase transition between type IIA superstring
  theory and M-theory. A detailed study of M-theory via lattice Monte Carlo simulations
  of the D0-brane matrix model might be doable with much smaller computational resources
  than previously expected.
