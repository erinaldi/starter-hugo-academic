abstract: We present a novel technique for the determination of the topological susceptibility
  (related to the variance of the distribution of global topological charge) from
  lattice gauge theory simulations, based on maximum-likelihood analysis of the Markov-chain
  Monte Carlo time series. This technique is expected to be particularly useful in
  situations where relatively few tunneling events are observed. Restriction to a
  lattice subvolume on which topological charge is not quantized is explored, and
  may lead to further improvement when the global topology is poorly sampled. We test
  our proposed method on a set of lattice data, and compare it to traditional methods.
