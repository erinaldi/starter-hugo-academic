abstract: In this review we summarize the ongoing effort to study extra-dimensional
  gauge theories with lattice simulations. In these models the Higgs field is identified
  with extra-dimensional components of the gauge field. The Higgs potential is generated
  by quantum corrections and is protected from divergencies by the higher dimensional
  gauge symmetry. Dimensional reduction to four dimensions can occur through compactification
  or localization. Gauge-Higgs unification models are often studied using perturbation
  theory. Numerical lattice simulations are used to go beyond these perturbative expectations
  and to include non-perturbative effects. We describe the known perturbative predictions
  and their fate in the strongly-coupled regime for various extra-dimensional models.
