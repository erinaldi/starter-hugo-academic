abstract: The difference from 4 to 6 $σ$ in the Hubble constant (H0 ) between the
  values observed with the local (Cepheids and Supernovae Ia, SNe Ia) and the high-z
  probes (Cosmic Microwave Background obtained by the Planck data) still challenges
  the astrophysics and cosmology community. Previous analysis has shown that there
  is an evolution in the Hubble constant that scales as f (z) = H0/(1 + z)$η$, where
  H0 is H0 (z = 0) and $η$ is the evolutionary parameter. Here, we investigate if
  this evolution still holds by using the SNe Ia gathered in the Pantheon sample and
  the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. We assume H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1 as the local value
  and divide the Pantheon into three bins ordered in increasing values of redshift.
  Similar to our previous analysis but varying two cosmological parameters contemporaneously
  (H0, $Ømega$0m in the $Łambda$CDM model and H0, wa in the w0waCDM model), for each
  bin we implement a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis (MCMC) obtaining the value
  of H0 assuming Gaussian priors to restrict the parameters spaces to values we expect
  from our prior knowledge of the current cosmological models and to avoid phantom
  Dark Energy models with w textless −1. Subsequently, the values of H0 are fitted
  with the model f (z). Our results show that a decreasing trend with $η$ ∼ 10−2 is
  still visible in this sample. The $η$ coefficient reaches zero in 2.0 $σ$ for the
  $Łambda$CDM model up to 5.8 $σ$ for w0waCDM model. This trend, if not due to statistical
  fluctuations, could be explained through a hidden astrophysical bias, such as the
  effect of stretch evolution, or it requires new theoretical models, a possible proposition
  is the modified gravity theories, f (R). This analysis is meant to further cast
  light on the evolution of H0 and it does not specifically focus on constraining
  the other parameters. This work is also a preparatory to understand how the combined
  probes still show an evolution of the H0 by redshift and what is the current status
  of simulations on GRB cosmology to obtain the uncertainties on the $Ømega$0m comparable
  with the ones achieved through SNe Ia.
