abstract: The LatKMI collaboration is studying systematically the dynamical properties
  of N_f = 4,8,12,16 SU(3) gauge theories using lattice simulations with (HISQ) staggered
  fermions. Exploring the spectrum of many-flavour QCD, and its scaling near the chiral
  limit, is mandatory in order to establish if one of these models realises the Walking
  Technicolor scenario. Although lattice technologies to study the mesonic spectrum
  are well developed, scalar flavour-singlet states still require extra effort to
  be determined. In addition, gluonic observables usually require large-statistic
  simulations and powerful noise-reduction techniques. In the following, we present
  useful spectroscopic methods to investigate scalar glueballs and scalar flavour-singlet
  mesons, together with the current status of the scalar spectrum in N_f = 12 QCD
  from the LatKMI collaboration.
