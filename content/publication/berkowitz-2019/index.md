abstract: Anchoring the nuclear interaction in QCD is a long-outstanding problem in
  nuclear physics. While the lattice community has made enormous progress in mesonic
  physics and single nucleon physics, continuum-limit physical-point multi-nucleon
  physics has remained out of reach. I will review CalLat's strategy for multi-nucleon
  spectroscopy and our latest results.
