 abstract = {Anchoring the nuclear interaction in QCD is a long-outstanding problem in nuclear physics. While the lattice community has made enormous progress in mesonic physics and single nucleon physics, continuum-limit physical-point multi-nucleon physics has remained out of reach. I will review CalLat's strategy for multi-nucleon spectroscopy and our latest results.},
