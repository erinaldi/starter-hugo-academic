abstract: Composite Higgs models must exhibit very different dynamics from quantum
  chromodynamics (QCD) regardless whether they describe the Higgs boson as a dilatonlike
  state or a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson. Large separation of scales and large anomalous
  dimensions are frequently desired by phenomenological models. Mass-split systems
  are well-suited for composite Higgs models because they are governed by a conformal
  fixed point in the ultraviolet but are chirally broken in the infrared. In this
  work we use lattice field theory calculations with domain wall fermions to investigate
  a system with four light and six heavy flavors. We demonstrate how a nearby conformal
  fixed point affects the properties of the four light flavors that exhibit chiral
  symmetry breaking in the infrared. Specifically we describe hyperscaling of dimensionful
  physical quantities and determine the corresponding anomalous mass dimension. We
  obtain $y_m=1+backslashgamma^*= 1.47(5)$ suggesting that $N_f=10$ lies inside the
  conformal window. Comparing the low energy spectrum to predictions of dilaton chiral
  perturbation theory, we observe excellent agreement which supports the expectation
  that the 4+6 mass-split system exhibits near-conformal dynamics with a relatively
  light $0^++$ isosinglet scalar.
