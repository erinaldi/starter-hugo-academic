abstract: This document is one of a series of white papers from the USQCD Collaboration.
  Here, we discuss opportunities for lattice field theory research to make an impact
  on models of new physics beyond the Standard Model, including composite Higgs, composite
  dark matter, and supersymmetric theories.
