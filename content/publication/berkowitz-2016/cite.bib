 abstract = {We pioneer a systematic, large-scale lattice simulation of D0-brane quantum mechanics. The large-\$N\$ and continuum limits of the gauge theory are taken for the first time at various temperatures \$0.4 \backslashleq T \backslashleq 1.0\$. As a way to directly test the gauge/gravity duality conjecture we compute the internal energy of the black hole directly from the gauge theory and reproduce the coefficient of the supergravity result \$E/N^2=7.41T^\14/5\\$. This is the first confirmation of the supergravity prediction for the internal energy of a black hole at finite temperature coming directly from the dual gauge theory. We also constrain stringy corrections to the internal energy.},
