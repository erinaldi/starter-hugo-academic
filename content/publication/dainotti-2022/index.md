abstract: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), observed up to $z=9.4$, can be employed as standardized
  candles, extending the distance ladder beyond Supernovae Type Ia (SNe Ia, $z=2.26$).
  We standardize GRBs using the 3D fundamental plane relation among the rest-frame
  end time of the X-ray plateau emission, its corresponding luminosity, and the peak
  prompt luminosity. Combining SNe Ia and GRBs, we constrain the matter content $backslashOmega_backslashtextM=
  0.299 backslashpm 0.009$ assuming a flat $backslashLambda$CDM cosmology with and
  without correcting for selection biases and redshift evolution. Using a similar
  3D correlation in optical, we find that our optical GRB sample is as efficacious
  in the determination of $backslashOmega_backslashtextM$ as the X-ray sample. We
  trimmed our GRB samples to achieve tighter planes to be used to simulate additional
  GRBs. We determined how many GRBs are needed to be used as standalone probes to
  achieve a comparable precision on $backslashOmega_backslashtextM$ to the one obtained
  by SNe Ia only. $backslash$bf We achieve the error measurements derived using SNe
  Ia in (Conley et al. 2011) with 142 GRBs in optical considering the errorbars on
  the variables halved and in Betoule et al. (2014) with 284 optical GRBs, by considering
  that the error bars on the variables halved. Using a doubled sample (obtained by
  future machine learning approaches that allow both a lightcurve reconstruction and
  the estimates of GRBs for which the GRB is unknown) compared to our current one,
  with errorbars halved we will reach the same precision of (Scolnic et al. 2018)
  with 390 GRBs which will be uses as efficient standalone probes as SNe Ia by 2054.
