 abstract = {LatKMI Collaboration discusses the topological insights in many-flavor QCD on the lattice. We explore walking/conformal/confining phase in \$N_\backslashmathrm\f\\$ = 4, 8 and 12 (in particular \$N_\backslashmathrm\f\\$ = 8) lattice QCD via the topological charge and susceptibility, eigenvalues and anomalous dimension.},
