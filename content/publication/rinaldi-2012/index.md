abstract: The phase diagram of five-dimensional SU(2) gauge theories with one compactified
  dimension on anisotropic lattices has a rich structure. In this contribution we
  show how to control non-perturbatively the scale hierarchy between the cut-off and
  the compactification scale in the bare parameter space. There exists a set of strong
  bare couplings where the the five-dimensional lattice theory can be described by
  an effective four-dimensional theory with a scalar field in the adjoint representation.
  We present a detailed study of the light scalar spectrum as it arises from the non-perturbative
  dynamics of the full five-dimensional lattice theory. We also investigate the mixing
  with scalar glueball states in the attempt to further establish the extra-dimensional
  nature of light scalar states.
