abstract: "The actual knowledge of the structure and future evolution of our universe\
  \ is based on the use of cosmological models, which can be tested through the so-called\
  \ 'probes', namely astrophysical phenomena, objects or structures with peculiar\
  \ properties that can help to discriminate among different cosmological models.\
  \ Among all the existing probes, of particular importance are the Supernovae Ia\
  \ (SNe Ia) and the Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs): the former are considered among the\
  \ best standard candles so far discovered but suffer from the fact that can be observed\
  \ until redshift $z=2.26$, while the latter are promising standardizable candles\
  \ which have been observed up to $z=9.4$, surpassing even the farthest quasar known\
  \ to date, which is at $z=7.64$. The standard candles can be used to test the cosmological\
  \ models and to give the expected values of cosmological parameters, in particular\
  \ the Hubble constant value. The Hubble constant is affected by the so-called $backslash$sayHubble\
  \ constant tension, a discrepancy in more than 4 $backslashsigma$ between its value\
  \ measured with local probes and its value measured through the cosmological probes.\
  \ The increase in the number of observed SNe Ia, as well as the future standardization\
  \ of GRBs through their correlations, will surely be of help in alleviating the\
  \ Hubble constant tension and in explaining the structure of the universe at higher\
  \ redshifts. A promising class of GRBs for future standardization is represented\
  \ by the GRBs associated with Supernovae Ib/c, since these present features similar\
  \ to the SNe Ia class and obey a tight correlation between their luminosity at the\
  \ end of the plateau emission in X-rays and the time at the end of the plateau in\
  \ the rest-frame."
