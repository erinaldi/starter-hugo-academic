abstract: Based on lattice simulations using highly improved staggered quarks for
  twelve-flavor QCD with several bare fermion masses, we observe a flavor-singlet
  scalar state lighter than the pion in the correlators of fermionic interpolating
  operators. The same state is also investigated using correlators of gluonic interpolating
  operators. Combined with our previous study, that showed twelve-flavor QCD to be
  consistent with being in the conformal window, we infer that the lightness of the
  scalar state is due to infrared conformality. This result shed some light on the
  possibility of a light composite Higgs boson (\"technidilaton\") in walking technicolor
  theories.
