abstract: We study an SU(3) gauge theory with Nf=8 degenerate flavors of light fermions
  in the fundamental representation. Using the domain wall fermion formulation, we
  investigate the light hadron spectrum, chiral condensate and electroweak S parameter.
  We consider a range of light fermion masses on two lattice volumes at a single gauge
  coupling chosen so that IR scales approximately match those from our previous studies
  of the two- and six-flavor systems. Our results for the Nf=8 spectrum suggest spontaneous
  chiral symmetry breaking, though fits to the fermion mass dependence of spectral
  quantities do not strongly disfavor the hypothesis of mass-deformed infrared conformality.
  Compared to Nf=2 we observe a significant enhancement of the chiral condensate relative
  to the symmetry breaking scale F, similar to the situation for Nf=6. The reduction
  of the S parameter, related to parity doubling in the vector and axial-vector channels,
  is also comparable to our six-flavor results.
