abstract: Matrix quantum mechanics plays various important roles in theoretical physics,
  such as a holographic description of quantum black holes. Understanding quantum
  black holes and the role of entanglement in a holographic setup is of paramount
  importance for the development of better quantum algorithms (quantum error correction
  codes) and for the realization of a quantum theory of gravity. Quantum computing
  and deep learning offer us potentially useful approaches to study the dynamics of
  matrix quantum mechanics. In this paper we perform a systematic survey for quantum
  computing and deep learning approaches to matrix quantum mechanics, comparing them
  to Lattice Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, we test the performance of each
  method by calculating the low-energy spectrum.
