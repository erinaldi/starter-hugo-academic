abstract: We entertain the possibility that neutrino masses and dark matter (DM) originate
  from a common composite dark sector. A minimal effective theory can be constructed
  based on a dark $SU(3)_D$ interaction with three flavors of massless dark quarks;
  electroweak symmetry breaking gives masses to the dark quarks. By assigning a $backslashmathbb
  Z_2$ charge to one flavor, a stable \"dark kaon\" can provide a good thermal relic
  DM candidate. We find that \"dark neutrons\" may be identified as right handed Dirac
  neutrinos. Some level of \"neutron-anti-neutron\" oscillation in the dark sector
  can then result in non-zero Majorana masses for light Standard Model neutrinos.
  A simple ultraviolet completion is presented, involving additional heavy $SU(3)_D$-charged
  particles with electroweak and lepton Yukawa couplings. At our benchmark point,
  there are \"dark pions\" that are much lighter than the Higgs and we expect spectacular
  collider signals arising from the UV framework. This includes the decay of the Higgs
  boson to $backslashtau backslashtau backslashell backslashell^backslashprime$, where
  $backslashell$($backslashell'$) can be any lepton, with displaced vertices. We discuss
  the observational signatures of this UV framework in dark matter searches and primordial
  gravitational wave experiments; the latter signature is potentially correlated with
  the $H backslashto backslashtau backslashtau backslashell backslashell^backslashprime$
  decay.
