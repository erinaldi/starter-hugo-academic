abstract: Motivated by the scenario of electroweak baryogenesis in the walking technicolor
  (WTC) model, we investigate thermodynamic properties of 8-flavor QCD by using Monte
  Carlo simulations in the lattice gauge theory framework. We adopt HISQ and tree-level
  Symanzik improved actions. We show that the chiral susceptibility has a peak structure,
  and that the ratio of chiral to pion susceptibilities starts showing an inflection
  point with decreasing fermion mass. These results suggest the existence of a chiral
  phase transition in 8-flavor QCD.
