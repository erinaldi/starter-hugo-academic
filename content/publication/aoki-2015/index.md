abstract: In the search for a composite Higgs boson in walking technicolor models,
  many flavor QCD, in particular with $N_f=8$, is an attractive candidate, and has
  been found to have a composite flavor-singlet scalar as light as the pion. Based
  on lattice simulations of this theory with the HISQ action, we will present our
  preliminary results on the scalar decay constant using the fermionic bilinear operator,
  and on the mass of the lightest baryon state which could be a dark matter candidate.
  Combining these two results, implications for dark matter direct detection are also
  discussed.
