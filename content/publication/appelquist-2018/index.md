abstract: We construct a generalized linear sigma model as an effective field theory
  (EFT) to describe nearly conformal gauge theories at low energies. The work is motivated
  by recent lattice studies of gauge theories near the conformal window, which have
  shown that the lightest flavor-singlet scalar state in the spectrum ($backslashsigma$)
  can be much lighter than the vector state ($backslashrho$) and nearly degenerate
  with the PNGBs ($backslashpi$) over a large range of quark masses. The EFT incorporates
  this feature. We highlight the crucial role played by the terms in the potential
  that explicitly break chiral symmetry. The explicit breaking can be large enough
  so that a limited set of additional terms in the potential can no longer be neglected,
  with the EFT still weakly coupled in this new range. The additional terms contribute
  importantly to the scalar and pion masses. In particular, they relax the inequality
  $M_backslashsigma2̂ backslashge 3 M_backslashpî$, allowing for consistency with
  current lattice data.
