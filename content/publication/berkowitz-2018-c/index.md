abstract: Outstanding problems in nuclear physics require input and guidance from
  lattice QCD calculations of few baryons systems. However, these calculations suffer
  from an exponentially bad signal-to-noise problem which has prevented a controlled
  extrapolation to the physical point. The variational method has been applied very
  successfully to two-meson systems, allowing for the extraction of the two-meson
  states very early in Euclidean time through the use of improved single hadron operators.
  The sheer numerical cost of using the same techniques in two-baryon systems has
  been prohibitive. We present an alternate strategy which offers some of the same
  advantages as the variational method while being significantly less numerically
  expensive. We first use the Matrix Prony method to form an optimal linear combination
  of single baryon interpolating fields generated from the same source and different
  sink interpolators. Very early in Euclidean time this linear combination is numerically
  free of excited state contamination, so we coin it a calm baryon. This calm baryon
  operator is then used in the construction of the two-baryon correlation functions.
  To test this method, we perform calculations on the WM/JLab iso-clover gauge configurations
  at the SU(3) flavor symmetric point with m$\$pi $\sim$ 800 MeV ---
  the same configurations we have previously used for the calculation of two-nucleon
  correlation functions. We observe the calm baryon removes the excited state contamination
  from the two-nucleon correlation function to as early a time as the single-nucleon
  is improved, provided non-local (displaced nucleon) sources are used. For the local
  two-nucleon correlation function (where both nucleons are created from the same
  space-time location) there is still improvement, but there is significant excited
  state contamination in the region the single calm baryon displays no excited state
  contamination.
