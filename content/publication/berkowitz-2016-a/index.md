abstract: We pioneer a systematic, large-scale lattice simulation of D0-brane quantum
  mechanics. The large-$N$ and continuum limits of the gauge theory are taken for
  the first time at various temperatures $0.4 backslashleq T backslashleq 1.0$. As
  a way to directly test the gauge/gravity duality conjecture we compute the internal
  energy of the black hole directly from the gauge theory and reproduce the coefficient
  of the supergravity result $E/N^2=7.41T^14/5$. This is the first confirmation of
  the supergravity prediction for the internal energy of a black hole at finite temperature
  coming directly from the dual gauge theory. We also constrain stringy corrections
  to the internal energy.
