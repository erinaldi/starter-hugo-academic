abstract: As a part of the project studying large $N_f$ QCD, the LatKMI Collaboration
  has been investigating the SU(3) gauge theory with four fundamental fermions (four-flavor
  QCD). The main purpose of studying four-flavor QCD is to provide a qualitative comparison
  to $N_f= 8$, $12$, $16$ QCD; however, a quantitative comparison to real-world QCD
  is also interesting. To make such comparisons more meaningful, it is desirable to
  use the same kind of lattice action consistently, so that qualitative difference
  of different theories are less affected by artifacts of lattice discretization.
  Here, we adopt the highly-improved staggered quark action with the tree-level Symanzik
  gauge action (HISQ/tree), which is exactly the same as the setup for our simulations
  for $SU(3)$ gauge theories with $N_f=8$, $12$ and $16$ fundamental fermionsÌƒ$\$citeAoki:2013xza,
  Aoki:2012eq, Aoki:2014oma. In the next section, we show the fermion mass dependence
  of $F_\pi$, $\langle\bar\psi\psi\rangle$,
  $M_\pi$, $M_\rho$, $M_N$ and their chiral extrapolations. In section
  3, preliminary results of the measurement of the mass of the flavor-singlet scalar
  bound state will be reported.
