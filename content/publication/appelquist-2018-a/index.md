abstract: We present our lattice studies of SU(3) gauge theory with $N_f$ = 8 degenerate
  fermions in the fundamental representation. Using nHYP-smeared staggered fermions
  we study finite-temperature transitions on lattice volumes as large as $L^3 backslashtimes
  N_t = 48^3 backslashtimes 24$, and the zero-temperature composite spectrum on lattice
  volumes up to $64^3 backslashtimes 128$. The spectrum indirectly indicates spontaneous
  chiral symmetry breaking, but finite-temperature transitions with fixed $N_t backslashleq
  24$ enter a strongly coupled lattice phase as the fermion mass decreases, which
  prevents a direct confirmation of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the chiral
  limit. In addition to the connected spectrum we focus on the lightest flavor-singlet
  scalar particle. We find it to be degenerate with the pseudo-Goldstone states down
  to the lightest masses reached so far by non-perturbative lattice calculations.
  Using the same lattice approach, we study the behavior of the composite spectrum
  when the number of light fermions is changed from eight to four. A heavy flavor-singlet
  scalar in the 4-flavor theory affirms the contrast between QCD-like dynamics and
  the low-energy behavior of the 8-flavor theory.
