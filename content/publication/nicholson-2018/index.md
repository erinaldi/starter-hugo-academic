abstract: Observation of neutrinoless double beta decay, a lepton number violating
  process that has been proposed to clarify the nature of neutrino masses, has spawned
  an enormous world-wide experimental effort. Relating nuclear decay rates to high-energy,
  beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics requires detailed knowledge of non-perturbative
  QCD effects. Using lattice QCD, we compute the necessary matrix elements of short-range
  operators, which arise due to heavy BSM mediators, that contribute to this decay
  via the leading order $backslashpi^- backslashto backslashpi^+$ exchange diagrams.
  Utilizing our result and taking advantage of effective field theory methods will
  allow for model-independent calculations of the relevant two-nucleon decay, which
  may then be used as input for nuclear many-body calculations of the relevant experimental
  decays. Contributions from short-range operators may prove to be equally important
  to, or even more important than, those from long-range Majorana neutrino exchange.
