abstract: We present a determination of nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts for
  l textgreater= 0. The S, P, D and F phase shifts for both the spin-triplet and spin-singlet
  channels are computed with lattice Quantum ChromoDynamics. For l textgreater 0,
  this is the first lattice QCD calculation using the Luscher finite-volume formalism.
  This required the design and implementation of novel lattice methods involving displaced
  sources and momentum-space cubic sinks. To demonstrate the utility of our approach,
  the calculations were performed in the SU(3)-flavor limit where the light quark
  masses have been tuned to the physical strange quark mass, corresponding to m_pi
  = m_K ̃ 800 MeV. In this work, we have assumed that only the lowest partial waves
  contribute to each channel, ignoring the unphysical partial wave mixing that arises
  within the finite-volume formalism. This assumption is only valid for sufficiently
  low energies; we present evidence that it holds for our study using two different
  channels. Two spatial volumes of V ̃ (3.5 fm)^3 and V ~̃ (4.6 fm)^3 were used. The
  finite-volume spectrum is extracted from the exponential falloff of the correlation
  functions. Said spectrum is mapped onto the infinite volume phase shifts using the
  generalization of the Luscher formalism for two-nucleon systems.
