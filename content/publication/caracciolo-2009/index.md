abstract: We discuss an algorithm for the exact sampling of vectors v in [0,1]^N satisfying
  a set of pairwise difference inequalities. Applications include the exact sampling
  of skew Young Tableaux, of configurations in the Bead Model, and of corrugated surfaces
  on a graph, that is random landscapes in which at each vertex corresponds a local
  maximum or minimum. As an example, we numerically evaluate with high-precision the
  number of corrugated surfaces on the square lattice. After an extrapolation to the
  thermodynamic limit, controlled by an exact formula, we put into evidence a discrepancy
  with previous numerical results.
