abstract: While the discovery of non-zero neutrino masses is one of the most important
  accomplishments by physicists in the past century, it is still unknown how and in
  what form these masses arise. Lepton number-violating neutrinoless double beta decay
  is a natural consequence of Majorana neutrinos and many BSM theories, and many experimental
  efforts are involved in the search for these processes. Understanding how neutrinoless
  double beta decay would manifest in nuclear environments is key for understanding
  any observed signals. In these proceedings we present an overview of a set of one-
  and two-body matrix elements relevant for experimental searches for neutrinoless
  double beta decay, describe the role of lattice QCD calculations, and present preliminary
  lattice QCD results.
