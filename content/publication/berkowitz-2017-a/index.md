abstract: We report on a lattice QCD calculation of the nucleon axial charge, $g_A$,
  using M$\$\"obius Domain-Wall fermions solved on the dynamical $N_f=2+1+1$
  HISQ ensembles after they are smeared using the gradient-flow algorithm. The calculation
  is performed with three pion masses, $m_\pi\sim\310,220,130\$
  MeV. Three lattice spacings ($a\sim\0.15,0.12,0.09\$ fm)
  are used with the heaviest pion mass, while the coarsest two spacings are used on
  the middle pion mass and only the coarsest spacing is used with the near physical
  pion mass. On the $m_\pi\sim220$ MeV, $a\sim0.12$ fm point,
  a dedicated volume study is performed with $m_\pi L \sim \3.22,4.29,5.36\$.
  Using a new strategy motivated by the Feynman-Hellmann Theorem, we achieve a precise
  determination of $g_A$ with relatively low statistics, and demonstrable control
  over the excited state, continuum, infinite volume and chiral extrapolation systematic
  uncertainties, the latter of which remains the dominant uncertainty. Our final determination
  at 2.6$\$% total uncertainty is $g_A = 1.278(21)(26)$, with the first uncertainty
  including statistical and systematic uncertainties from fitting and the second including
  model selection systematics related to the chiral and continuum extrapolation. The
  largest reduction of the second uncertainty will come from a greater number of pion
  mass points as well as more precise lattice QCD results near the physical pion mass.
