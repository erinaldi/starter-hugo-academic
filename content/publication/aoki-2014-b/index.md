abstract: 'In search for a composite Higgs boson (techni-dilaton) in the walking technicolor,
  we present our preliminary results on the first observation of a light flavor-singlet
  scalar in a candidate theory for the walking technicolor, the Nf=8 QCD, which was
  found in our previous paper to have spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking together
  with remnants of the conformality. Based on simulations with the HISQ-type action
  on several lattice sizes with various fermion masses, we find evidence of a flavor-singlet
  scalar meson with mass comparable to that of the Nambu-Goldstone pion in both the
  small fermion-mass region, where chiral perturbation theory works, and the intermediate
  fermion-mass region where the hyperscaling relation holds. We further discuss its
  chiral limit extrapolation in comparison with other states studied in our previous
  paper: the scalar has a mass much smaller than that of the vector meson, which is
  compared to the Nambu-Goldstone pion having a vanishing mass in that limit.'
