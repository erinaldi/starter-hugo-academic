abstract: Fundamental symmetry tests of baryon number violation in low-energy experiments
  can probe beyond the Standard Model explanations of the matter-antimatter asymmetry
  of the universe. Neutron-antineutron oscillations are predicted to be a signature
  of many baryogenesis mechanisms involving low-scale baryon number violation. This
  work presents the first complete lattice quantum chromodynamics calculation of the
  six-quark matrix elements needed to connect experimental measurements of the neutron-antineutron
  oscillation rate to constraints on beyond the Standard Model theories. State-of-the-art
  lattice gauge field configurations at the physical pion mass are used and the lattice
  matrix elements are renormalized nonperturbatively and converted to the $\overlineMS$
  scheme at 2 GeV, where perturbative scale running can be used to connect them to
  BSM theories. Phenomenological implications are highlighted by comparing the constraints
  of proposed neutron-antineutron experiments to predictions of a specific model of
  post-sphaleron baryogenesis. These results from lattice quantum chromodynamics are
  also compared to previous estimates from the MIT bag model.
