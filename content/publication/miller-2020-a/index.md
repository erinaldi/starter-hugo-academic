abstract: We report on a sub-percent scale determination using the omega baryon mass
  and gradient-flow methods. The calculations are performed on 22 ensembles of $N_f=2+1+1$
  highly improved, rooted staggered sea-quark configurations generated by the MILC
  and CalLat Collaborations. The valence quark action used is M$backslash$\"obius
  Domain-Wall fermions solved on these configurations after a gradient-flow smearing
  is applied with a flowtime of $t_backslashrm gf=1$ in lattice units. The ensembles
  span four lattice spacings in the range $0.06 backslashlesssim a backslashlesssim
  0.15$ fm, six pion masses in the range $130 backslashlesssim m_backslashpi backslashlesssim
  400$ MeV and multiple lattice volumes. On each ensemble, the gradient-flow scales
  $t_0/a^2$ and $w_0/a$ and the omega baryon mass $a m_backslashOmega$ are computed.
  The dimensionless product of these quantities is then extrapolated to the continuum
  and infinite volume limits and interpolated to the physical light, strange and charm
  quark mass point in the isospin limit, resulting in the determination of $backslashsqrtt_0=0.1422(14)$
  fm and $w_0 = 0.1709(11)$ fm with all sources of statistical and systematic uncertainty
  accounted for. The dominant uncertainty in this result is the stochastic uncertainty,
  providing a clear path for a few-per-mille uncertainty, as recently obtained by
  the Budapest-Marseille-Wuppertal Collaboration.
