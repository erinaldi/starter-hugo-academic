 abstract = {We present new lattice investigations of finite-temperature transitions for SU(3) gauge theory with Nf=8 light flavors. Using nHYP-smeared staggered fermions we are able to explore renormalized couplings \$g^2 \backslashlesssim 20\$ on lattice volumes as large as \$48^3 \backslashtimes 24\$. Finite-temperature transitions at non-zero fermion mass do not persist in the chiral limit, instead running into a strongly coupled lattice phase as the mass decreases. That is, finite-temperature studies with this lattice action require even larger \$N_T \textgreater 24\$ to directly confirm spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking.},
