abstract: We present new lattice investigations of finite-temperature transitions
  for SU(3) gauge theory with Nf=8 light flavors. Using nHYP-smeared staggered fermions
  we are able to explore renormalized couplings $g^2 \lesssim 20$ on lattice
  volumes as large as $48^3 \times 24$. Finite-temperature transitions at
  non-zero fermion mass do not persist in the chiral limit, instead running into a
  strongly coupled lattice phase as the mass decreases. That is, finite-temperature
  studies with this lattice action require even larger $N_T textgreater 24$ to directly
  confirm spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking.
