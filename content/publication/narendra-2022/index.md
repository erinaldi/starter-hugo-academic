abstract: Measuring the redshift of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) requires the use
  of time-consuming and expensive spectroscopic analysis. However, obtaining redshift
  measurements of AGNs is crucial as it can enable AGN population studies, provide
  insight into the star formation rate, the luminosity function, and the density rate
  evolution. Hence, there is a requirement for alternative redshift measurement techniques.
  In this project, we aim to use the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope's 4LAC Data Release
  2 catalog to train a machine-learning (ML) model capable of predicting the redshift
  reliably. In addition, this project aims at improving and extending with the new
  4LAC Catalog the predictive capabilities of the ML methodology published in Dainotti
  et al. Furthermore, we implement feature engineering to expand the parameter space
  and a bias correction technique to our final results. This study uses additional
  ML techniques inside the ensemble method, the SuperLearner, previously used in Dainotti
  et al. Additionally, we also test a novel ML model called Sorted L-One Penalized
  Estimation. Using these methods, we provide a catalog of estimated redshift values
  for those AGNs that do not have a spectroscopic redshift measurement. These estimates
  can serve as a redshift reference for the community to verify as updated Fermi catalogs
  are released with more redshift measurements.
