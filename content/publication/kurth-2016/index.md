abstract: 'The electroweak interaction at the level of quarks and gluons are well
  understood from precision measurements in high energy collider experiments. Relating
  these fundamental parameters to Hadronic Parity Violation in nuclei however remains
  an outstanding theoretical challenge. One of the most interesting observables in
  this respect is the parity violating hadronic neutral current: it is hard to measure
  in collider experiments and is thus the least constrained observable of the Standard
  Model. Precision measurements of parity violating transitions in nuclei can help
  to improve these constraints. In these systems however, the weak interaction is
  masked by effects of the seven orders of magnitude stronger non-perturbative strong
  interaction. Therefore, in order to relate experimental measurements of the parity
  violating pion-nucleon couplings to the fundamental Lagrangian of the SM, these
  non-perturbative effects have to be well understood. In this paper, we are going
  to present a Lattice QCD approach for computing the $\Delta I=2$ parity
  violating matrix element in proton proton scattering. This process does not involve
  disconnected diagrams in the isospin symmetric limit and is thus a perfect testbed
  for studying the feasibility of the more involved calculation of the parity violating
  pion-nucleon coupling.'
