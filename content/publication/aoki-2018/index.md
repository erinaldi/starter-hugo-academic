abstract: Studying SU(3) gauge theories with increasing number of light fermions is
  relevant both for understanding the strong dynamics of QCD and for constructing
  strongly interacting extensions of the Standard Model (e.g. UV completions of composite
  Higgs models). In order to contrast these many-flavors strongly interacting theories
  with QCD, we study the flavor-singlet spectrum as an interesting probe. In fact,
  some composite Higgs models require the Higgs boson to be the lightest flavor-singlet
  scalar in the spectrum of a strongly interacting new sector with a well defined
  hierarchy with the rest of the states. Moreover, introducing many light flavors
  at fixed number of colors can influence the dynamics of the lightest flavor-singlet
  pseudoscalar. We present the on-going study of these flavor-singlet channels using
  multiple interpolating operators on high-statistics ensembles generated by the LatKMI
  collaboration and we compare results with available data obtained by the Lattice
  Strong Dynamics collaboration. For the theory with 8 flavors, the two collaborations
  have generated configurations that complement each others with the aim to tackle
  the massless limit using the largest possible volumes.
