abstract: We present the first observation of a flavor-singlet scalar meson as light
  as the pion in $N_f=8$ QCD on the lattice, using the Highly Improved Staggered Quark
  action. Such a light scalar meson can be regarded as a composite Higgs with mass
  125 GeV. In accord with our previous lattice results showing that the theory exhibits
  walking behavior, the light scalar may be a technidilaton, a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone
  boson of the approximate scale symmetry in walking technicolor.
