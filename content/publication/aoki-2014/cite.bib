 abstract = {We present the first observation of a flavor-singlet scalar meson as light as the pion in \$N_f=8\$ QCD on the lattice, using the Highly Improved Staggered Quark action. Such a light scalar meson can be regarded as a composite Higgs with mass 125 GeV. In accord with our previous lattice results showing that the theory exhibits walking behavior, the light scalar may be a technidilaton, a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson of the approximate scale symmetry in walking technicolor.},
