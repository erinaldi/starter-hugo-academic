abstract: We report the results of a lattice quantum chromodynamics calculation of
  $F_K/F_backslashpi$ using M$backslash$\"obius domain-wall fermions computed on gradient-flowed
  $N_f=2+1+1$ highly-improved staggered quark (HISQ) ensembles. The calculation is
  performed with five values of the pion mass ranging from $130 backslashlesssim m_backslashpi
  backslashlesssim 400$ MeV, four lattice spacings of $abackslashsim 0.15, 0.12, 0.09$
  and $0.06$ fm and multiple values of the lattice volume. The interpolation/extrapolation
  to the physical pion and kaon mass point, the continuum, and infinite volume limits
  are performed with a variety of different extrapolation functions utilizing both
  the relevant mixed-action effective field theory expressions as well as discretization-enhanced
  continuum chiral perturbation theory formulas. We find that the $abackslashsim0.06$
  fm ensemble is helpful, but not necessary to achieve a subpercent determination
  of $F_K/F_backslashpi$. We also include an estimate of the strong isospin breaking
  corrections and arrive at a final result of $F_K^backslashpm/F_backslashpi^backslashpm
  = 1.1942(45)$ with all sources of statistical and systematic uncertainty included.
  This is consistent with the Flavour Lattice Averaging Group average value, providing
  an important benchmark for our lattice action. Combining our result with experimental
  measurements of the pion and kaon leptonic decays leads to a determination of $|V_us|/|V_ud|
  = 0.2311(10)$.
