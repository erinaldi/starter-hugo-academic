abstract: We present the spectrum of baryons in a new SU(4) gauge theory with fundamental
  fermion constituents. The spectrum of these bosonic baryons is of significant interest
  for composite dark matter theories. Here, we compare the spectrum and properties
  of SU(3) and SU(4) baryons, and then compute the dark-matter direct detection cross
  section via Higgs boson exchange for TeV-scale composite dark matter arising from
  a confining SU(4) gauge sector. Comparison with the latest LUX results leads to
  tight bounds on the fraction of the constituent-fermion mass that may arise from
  electroweak symmetry breaking. Lattice calculations of the dark matter mass spectrum
  and the Higgs-dark matter coupling are performed on quenched $16^3 backslashtimes
  32$, $32^3 backslashtimes 64$, $48^3 backslashtimes 96$, and $64^3 backslashtimes128$
  lattices with three different lattice spacings, using Wilson fermions with moderate
  to heavy pseudoscalar meson masses. Our results lay a foundation for future analytic
  and numerical study of composite baryonic dark matter.
