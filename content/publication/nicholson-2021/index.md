abstract: Lattice QCD calculations of two-nucleon interactions have been underway
  for about a decade, but still haven't reached the pion mass regime necessary for
  matching onto effective field theories and extrapolating to the physical point.
  Furthermore, results from different methods, including the use of the Luscher formalism
  with different types of operators, as well as the HALQCD potential method, do not
  agree even qualitatively at very heavy pion mass. We investigate the role that different
  operators employed in the literature may play on the extraction of spectra for use
  within the Luscher method. We first explore expectations from Effective Field Theory
  solved within a finite volume, for which the exact spectrum may be computed given
  different physical scenarios. We then present preliminary lattice QCD results for
  two-nucleon spectra calculated using different operators on a common lattice ensemble.
