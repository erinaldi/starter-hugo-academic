abstract: The Lattice Strong Dynamics collaboration is investigating the properties
  of a SU(3) gauge theory with $N_f = 8$ light fermions on the lattice. We measure
  the masses of the lightest pseudoscalar, scalar and vector states using simulations
  with the nHYP staggered-fermion action on large volumes and at small fermion masses,
  reaching $M_backslashrho/M_backslashpi backslashapprox 2.2$. The axial-vector meson
  and the nucleon are also studied for the same range of fermion masses. One of the
  interesting features of this theory is the dynamical presence of a light flavor-singlet
  scalar state with $0^++$ quantum numbers that is lighter than the vector resonance
  and has a mass consistent with the one of the pseudoscalar state for the whole fermion
  mass range explored. We comment on the existence of such state emerging from our
  lattice simulations and on the challenges of its analysis. Moreover we highlight
  the difficulties in pursuing simulations in the chiral regime of this theory using
  large volumes.
