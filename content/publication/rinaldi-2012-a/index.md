abstract: We study the phase diagram of the SU(2) lattice gauge theory with fundamental-adjoint
  Wilson plaquette action. We confirm the presence of a first order bulk phase transition
  and we estimate the location of its end-point in the bare parameter space. If this
  point is second order, the theory is one of the simplest realizations of a lattice
  gauge theory admitting a continuum limit at finite bare couplings. All the relevant
  gauge observables are monitored in the vicinity of the fixed point with very good
  control over finite-size effects. The scaling properties of the low-lying glueball
  spectrum are studied while approaching the end-point in a controlled manner.
