abstract: Open quantum systems can undergo dissipative phase transitions, and their
  critical behavior can be exploited in sensing applications. For example, it can
  be used to enhance the fidelity of superconducting qubit readout measurements, a
  central problem toward the creation of reliable quantum hardware. A recently introduced
  measurement protocol, named ``critical parametric quantum sensing'', uses the parametric
  (two-photon driven) Kerr resonator's driven-dissipative phase transition to reach
  single-qubit detection fidelity of 99.9$backslash$% [arXiv:2107.04503]. In this
  work, we improve upon the previous protocol by using machine learning-based classification
  algorithms to $backslash$textitefficiently and rapidly extract information from
  this critical dynamics, which has so far been neglected to focus only on stationary
  properties. These classification algorithms are applied to the time series data
  of weak quantum measurements (homodyne detection) of a circuit-QED implementation
  of the Kerr resonator coupled to a superconducting qubit. This demonstrates how
  machine learning methods enable a faster and more reliable measurement protocol
  in critical open quantum systems.
