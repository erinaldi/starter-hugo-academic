abstract: We determine scattering phase shifts for S,P,D, and F partial wave channels
  in two-nucleon systems using lattice QCD methods. We use a generalization of Luscher's
  finite volume method to determine infinite volume phase shifts from a set of finite
  volume ground- and excited-state energy levels on two volumes, V=(3.4 fm)^3 and
  V=(4.5 fm)^3. The calculations are performed in the SU(3)-flavor limit, corresponding
  to a pion mass of approximately 800 MeV. From the energy dependence of the phase
  shifts we are able to extract scattering parameters corresponding to an effective
  range expansion.
