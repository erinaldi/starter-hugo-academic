abstract: 'Precision experimental tests of the Standard Model of particle physics
  (SM) are one of our best hopes for discovering what new physics lies beyond the
  SM (BSM). Key in the search for new physics is the connection between theory and
  experiment. Forging this connection for searches involving low-energy hadronic or
  nuclear environments requires the use of a non-perturbative theoretical tool, lattice
  QCD. We present two recent lattice QCD calculations by the CalLat collaboration
  relevant for new physics searches: the nucleon axial coupling, $g_A$, whose precise
  value as predicted by the SM could help point to new physics contributions to the
  so-called \"neutron lifetime puzzle\", and hadronic matrix elements of short-ranged
  operators relevant for neutrinoless double beta decay searches.'
