abstract: Hyperon decays present a promising alternative for extracting $backslashvert
  V_us backslashvert$ from lattice QCD combined with experimental measurements. Currently
  $backslashvert V_us backslashvert$ is determined from the kaon decay widths and
  a lattice calculation of the associated form factor. In this proceeding, I will
  present preliminary work on a lattice determination of the hyperon mass spectrum.
  I will additionally summarize future goals in which we will calculate the hyperon
  transition matrix elements, which will provide an alternative means for accessing
  $backslashvert V_us backslashvert$. This work is based on a particular formulation
  of SU(2) chiral perturbation theory for hyperons; determining the extent to which
  this effective field theory converges is instrumental in understanding the limits
  of its predictive power, especially since some hyperonic observables are difficult
  to calculate near the physical pion mass (e.g., hyperon-to-nucleon form factors),
  and thus the use of heavier than physical pion masses is likely to yield more precise
  results when combined with extrapolations to the physical point.
