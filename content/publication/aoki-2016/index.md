abstract: 'Based on the highly improved staggered quark action, we perform lattice
  simulations of $N_f=8$ QCD and confirm our previous observation of a flavor-singlet
  scalar meson (denoted as $\sigma$) as light as the pion and various \"walking
  signals\" through low-lying spectra, with higher statistics, smaller fermion masses
  $m_f$, and larger volumes. We measure $M_\pi$, $F_\pi$, $M_\rho$,
  $M_a_0$, $M_a_1$, $M_b_1$, $M_N$, $M_\sigma$, $F_\sigma$, $\langle
  \bar\psi \psi\rangle$ (both directly and through
  the GMOR relation), and the string tension. The data are consistent with the spontaneously
  broken phase of the chiral symmetry, in agreement with the previous results: ratios
  of the quantities to $M_\pi$ monotonically increase in the smaller $m_f$
  region towards the chiral limit similarly to $N_f=4$ QCD, in sharp contrast to $N_f=12$
  QCD where the ratios become flattened. The hyperscaling relation holds with roughly
  a universal value of the anomalous dimension, $\gamma_m \simeq 1$,
  with a notable exception of $M_\pi$ with $\gamma_m \simeq
  0.6$ as in the previous results. This is a salient feature (\"walking signal\")
  of $N_f=8$, unlike either $N_f=4$ which has no hyperscaling relation at all, or
  $N_f=12$ QCD which exhibits universal hyperscaling. We further confirm the previous
  observation of the light $\sigma$ with mass comparable to the pion in the
  studied $m_f$ region. In a chiral limit extrapolation of the $\sigma$ mass
  using the dilaton chiral perturbation theory and also using the simple linear fit,
  we find the value consistent with the 125 GeV Higgs boson within errors. Our results
  suggest that the theory could be a good candidate for walking technicolor model,
  having anomalous dimension $\gamma_m \simeq 1$ and a light flavor-singlet
  scalar meson as a technidilaton, which can be identified with the 125 GeV composite
  Higgs in $N_f=8$ one-family model.'
